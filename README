This repository contains an implementation of the cryptographic
encrypt-to-self primitive introduced in 2020 by Pijnenburg and
Poettering.

Corresponding academic treatments of the encrypt-to-self primitive can
be found in:

* Pijnenburg and Poettering: "Encrypt-to-self: Securely Outsourcing Storage"
  (ESORICS'20)
* Pijnenburg and Poettering: "Efficiency Improvements for Encrypt-to-Self"
  (CYSARM'20)


The implementation is based on the compression functions of SHA256,
SHA512, and BLAKE2. By default the authors recommend using the BLAKE2
based implementation.


For a usage example see example.c in the current directory. Compile
and run it as follows:

$  make -C src
$  make example
$  ./example


To run the selftests:

$  make -C src
$  make -C test
$  test/sha256cf_selftest
$  test/sha512cf_selftest
$  test/blake2cf_selftest
$  test/ets_selftest
